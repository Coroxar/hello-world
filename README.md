# hello-world


Hello there!

Daniel here, just another IT student from Poland. I started being intrested in IT merely
one and a half year ago, so i'm still fresh. Though i hope this passion will stay with me for many more years.
Have some mercy on me as you comment or review, but i wish to hear as many productive opinions to help me 
learn more efficient ways of doing things as i can. 

Wish you all good day/night/evening/morning (choose one) and let's get started! :D
